# Quantitative Finance Bootcamp Projects (Summer 2025)

This repository contains a set of four mini projects completed as part of the **Quantitative Finance Summer Bootcamp** organized by the **Erdős Institute** in 2025. Each project applies foundational quantitative finance concepts using real-world data and Python-based analysis.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Portfolio Optimization
Constructed and analyzed **two investment portfolios** (high-risk and low-risk) using historical stock data (2015–2025) from Yahoo Finance.  
- Applied constraints on weight allocations
- Computed returns, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios
- Used `scipy.optimize` for portfolio weight optimization
- Visualized allocations and performance metrics

➡️ *Key Outcome:* Successfully optimized both portfolios under different risk constraints and quantitatively justified their profiles using Sharpe ratios and volatility-return tradeoffs.

### Project 2: Testing Normality of Returns
Tested the **normality assumption** in stock returns using:
- Shapiro-Wilk and D'Agostino-Pearson tests
- Rolling window normality testing
- Return filtering via clipping (to simulate outlier control)
- Comparison of raw vs. filtered return distributions

➡️ *Key Outcome:* Showed that while individual stocks often deviate from normality, filtered portfolios can exhibit closer-to-normal behavior. Visualized the evolution of p-values over time.

### Project 3: Option Sensitivities (Greeks)
Explored how **option price sensitivities** (Delta and Theta) vary with:
- Spot price (for a fixed time to maturity)
- Time to maturity (for a fixed spot price)
- Interest rate variations

Generated heatmaps and surface plots using the Black-Scholes model for both call and put options.

➡️ *Key Outcome:* Built intuition behind the Greeks and their dynamic behavior; visualized how options behave under different market conditions.

### Project 4: Delta and Sigma Hedging under Stochastic Volatility
Simulated stock paths using advanced volatility models:
- **Heston**, **SABR**, **GARCH(1,1)**, and a custom sigma model
- Implemented **Black-Scholes Delta Hedging**
- Extended to **Static and Dynamic Sigma (Vega) Hedging**
- Compared profit distributions across models

➡️ *Key Outcome:* Demonstrated the limitations of traditional delta hedging under non-constant volatility, and explored how vega exposure can improve hedging — especially for SABR-type dynamics.
